The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It is the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System and the largest and most massive relative to its parent planet, with a diameter about 
one-quarter that of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia). The Moon is a planetary-mass object with a differentiated rocky body, making it a satellite planet under the geophysical 
definitions of the term and larger than all known dwarf planets of the Solar System. The Moon orbits Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi).
